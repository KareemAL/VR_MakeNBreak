# VR_MakeNBreak
**VR game based on the board game "Make'nBreak" using VR Handtracking**


Project Name: VR MakeNBreak
Group Members: Alina Baumann, Kareem Al-Khalily

Shot Description: derived from the real "MakeNBreak" board game, this is a game all about copying buliding plans made of differently shaped blocks. Here the concept of the board game has been transfered into VR using hand-tracking.



IMPORTANT: Due to an error in our SDK we were unfortunately not able to build a working executable for our game. In order to watch/play the game we can only provide the shot videocapture in this .zip or you can access the github repository here
